# Project Readability Lab

Now that you have reviewed the impact of markdown, found text to enhance with markdown, and enhanced code with comments; it is time to apply this knowledge to your own projects.

## Review Your Own Project Text and Code

Use the following questions to aid your review:

### Markdown
- Are the headings enhanced with markdown?
- Are all external links hyperlinked in text?
- Would any information be better in a list?
- Is the most important information emphasized appropriately?

### Comments
- Could someone else read your code and describe your process?
- Do your functioons have docstrings?
- How many comments are in your code?
- How descriptive are your comments?
